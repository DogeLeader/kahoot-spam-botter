# kahoot-spam-botter

Kahoot spam botter to use in your school kahoot games!
Working as of 7/14/2022 - will be updated to work if doesn't in future.

To run, you must have Node JS installed. Then:

Open the folder on your command prompt.
Then run:

## "npm i" or "npm install".

Then, to start the script run:

## "npm run start"

Then, add in your pin, bot name, and bot count. And watch the magic. (Bots answer randomly).
The bots also show in the command line if: kicked (disconnected), wrong pin, duplicate name, quiz started, quiz ended, question answered, and more!
